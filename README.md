Welcome to Dots
==========================

Please note this is an ongoing/ progressive work and the product is not ready for public.

The current working version of the game is located in the following URL:
[http://mromi.com/dotsgame/](http://mromi.com/dotsgame/)


The main forcus on the current version as of 2/01/2015, is to implement the basic javascript functionalities to have a simple working version.  This version uses DOM manipulation. There is no port to any other devices than a PC browser and no third part frameworks are being used.

Once the basic functionality is implemented, the application UI will be ported to HTML5 Canvas and some modules will be added based on observable, mediator and prototype patterns.   Once the above items are completed, the next version will have a port to iOS and Android by using Cordova.
